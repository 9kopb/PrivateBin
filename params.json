It was refactored\r\nto allow easier and cleaner extensions and has now much more features than the\r\noriginal. It is however still fully compatible to the original ZeroBin 0.19\r\ndata storage scheme. Therefore such installations can be upgraded to this fork\r\nwithout loosing any data.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://cdn.rawgit.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/master/img/icon.svg\" height=\"200\" />\r\n\r\n## What PrivateBin provides\r\n\r\n+ As a server administrator you don't have to worry if your users post content\r\n  that is considered illegal in your country. You have no knowledge of any\r\n  of the pastes content. If requested or enforced, you can delete any paste from\r\n  your system.\r\n\r\n+ Pastebin-like system to store text documents, code samples, etc.\r\n\r\n+ Encryption of data sent to server.\r\n\r\n+ Possibility to set a password which is required to read the paste. It further\r\n  protects a paste and prevents people stumbling upon your paste's link\r\n  from being able to read it without the password.\r\n\r\n## What it doesn't provide\r\n\r\n- As a user you have to trust the server administrator, your internet provider\r\n  and any country the traffic passes not to inject any malicious javascript code.\r\n  Ideally, the PrivateBin installation used should provide HTTPS, secured by\r\n  [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) and\r\n  [HPKP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Public_Key_Pinning) using a\r\n  certificate either validated by a trusted third party (check the certificate\r\n  when first using a new PrivateBin instance) or self-signed by the server\r\n  operator, validated using a\r\n  [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions)\r\n  protected\r\n  [DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities)\r\n  record.\r\n\r\n- The \"key\" used to encrypt the paste is part of the URL. If you publicly post\r\n  the URL of a paste that is not password-protected, everybody can read it.\r\n  Use a password if you want your paste to be private. In this case make sure to\r\n  use a strong password and do only share it privately and end-to-end-encrypted.\r\n\r\n- A server admin might be forced to hand over access logs to the authorities.\r\n  PrivateBin encrypts your text and the discussion contents, but who accessed it\r\n  first might still be disclosed via such access logs.\r\n\r\n- In case of a server breach your data is secure as it is only stored encrypted\r\n  on the server. However the server could be misused or the server admin could\r\n  be legally forced into sending malicious JavaScript to all web users, which\r\n  grabs the decryption key and send it to the server when a user accesses a\r\n  PrivateBin.  \r\n  Therefore do not access any PrivateBin instance if you think it has been\r\n  compromised. As long as no user accesses this instance with a previously\r\n  generated URL, the content can''t be decrypted.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\nSome features are optional and can be enabled or disabled in the [configuration\r\nfile](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration):\r\n\r\n* Password protection\r\n\r\n* Discussions\r\n\r\n* Expiration times, including a \"forever\" and \"burn after reading\" option\r\n\r\n* Markdown format support for HTML formatted pastes\r\n\r\n* Syntax highlighting for source code using prettify.js, including 4 prettify\r\n  themes\r\n\r\n* File upload support, images get displayed (disabled by default, possibility\r\n  to adjust size limit)\r\n\r\n* Templates: By default there is a bootstrap CSS and a \"classic ZeroBin\" theme\r\n  and it is easy to adapt these to your own websites layout or create your own.\r\n\r\n* Translation system and automatic browser language detection (if enabled in\r\n  browser)\r\n\r\n* Language selection (disabled by default, as it uses a session cookie)\r\n\r\n## Further resources\r\n\r\n* [Installation guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Installation)\r\n\r\n* [Upgrading from ZeroBin 0.19 Alpha](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Upgrading-from-ZeroBin-0.19-Alpha)\r\n\r\n* [Configuration guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration)\r\n\r\n* [Templates](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Templates)\r\n\r\n* [Translation guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Translation)\r\n\r\n* [Developer guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Development)\r\n\r\nRun into any issues?
